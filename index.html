<h2>Description &amp; Purpose</h2>
<p>Quantum computing is becoming real: Several vendors offer quantum computers in the cloud or on premise, companies invest to become familiar with this technology and its potentials, several software companies build corresponding tools, and consulting companies offer services to build solutions. Many applications will benefit from quantum technologies because a lot of intractable problems (in the sense of complexity classes) may realize up to exponential speedups on quantum computers.</p>
<p>However, software to be run on a quantum computer is quite different from software for classical computers. Thus, the current state of the art is that solutions are hand-crafted in an ad-hoc manner and a solid foundation for building and integrating quantum software is missing.</p>
<p>The goal of the QSA workshop is to bring together researchers and practitioners from different areas of quantum computing and (classical) software architecture to strengthen the quantum software community and discuss architectural styles and best practices of quantum software as well as other aspects of the quantum software development lifecycle.</p>
<p>The workshop offers a platform for the presentation of novel scientific ideas as well as practical experiences and enables the exchange with experts from different areas of quantum computing.</p>
